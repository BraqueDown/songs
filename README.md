## Publishing your charts

To publish a song, the chart must go under review and be validated.
In order to publish a song, follow these steps:

- Fork the `songs` repository

    Create a fork of this repository by clicking on the **Fork** button. *Don't clone it!*

- Archive your song
    
    Package the `info.json`, stems, and album art into a folder. After, create a ***zip*** archive of the folder.

    The limit for uploading files is **100 MB**, as set by GitHub. However, we recommend your zip to be under **20 MB**.

    Only **zip** files are accepted.

- Upload the song

    To upload your song as a **zip** archive, press the **Add File** button, located besides the green **Code** button.

    After, click on the **Upload files** button that shows up in the dropdown menu.

    Now, drag your **zip** song to the page.

    After your **zip** is done uploading, it will show up below the space to drag. If you'd like to add multiple charts at once, these will go under review as well.

    After, click on **Commit changes** to confirm the song upload. Make sure you are committing to the **main** branch.

- Create the pull request

    Click on the **Contribute** button below **Add file**. After that, click on **Open pull request**

    Under **Add a title**, specify your song name.

    Under **Add a description**, specify some details about the song/chart.

    When you are done, click on **Create pull request**.

- Wait for approval

    Your chart will be approved after it is verified.

    When your chart is verified and the pull request is merged, you will be able to see it in [FNLookup](https://fnlookup.github.io/encore/), where it will be given an ID.
